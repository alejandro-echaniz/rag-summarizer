Course Description 
Stat 401 is a class on (classical) statistical techniques for students who have had an introductory class in probability 
such as Stat 400 or Stat 410 (or any class with comparable content). After reviewing concepts from probability  we 
will focus our attention on covering topics related to  estimators, mean squared error, maximum likelihood 
estimators,  confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, ANOVA, regression and some non-parametric methods.

We will focus on covering most of Ch 6-8, 10, 12 as well as selected topics from Ch 13 and some techniques 
from nonparametric statistics.   
●​ Application/Software: (Required) R, RStudio 
Prerequisites: The prerequisites for this class are Stat 400 or Stat 410 (as well as familiarity with calculus). I will be 
working under the assumption that you have a solid grounding in the material from the prerequisite classes as well 
as differentiation and integration. While we will review some of the material initially, I will not be able to 
re-teach the material in its entirety in class. You may want to spend some time reviewing this material. Chapter 2 - 5  
of the required text can be used to review this material and can be referred to throughout the semester as needed.

Course Guidelines 
ELMS: I will send IMPORTANT announcements via ELMS messaging. You must make sure that your email & 
announcement notifications (including changes in assignments and/or due dates) are enabled in ELMS so you do 
not miss any messages. You are responsible for checking your email and Canvas/ELMS inbox with regular frequency 
(I would suggest once a day, but twice a day, at the start and end of the day is preferable). 
Email: If you need to reach out and communicate with me, please email me at danulg@umd.edu using your official 
UMD account. Please DO NOT email me with questions that are easily found in the syllabus or on ELMS (i.e. When is 
this assignment due? How much is it worth? etc.) but please DO reach out about personal, academic, and 
intellectual concerns/questions related to the class. I will do my best to respond to emails within 24 hours 
(excluding weekends) and 48 hours at the most. In the extremely unlikely case that you do not hear back from me 
within 48 hours, please feel free to follow up with me. Please include the course and section number in all of your 
email communications. Emails without this information will likely receive replies that fall outside the 24-48 hour 
window for responses. 
Grades 
Your work will be graded for completeness, correctness and clarity. Note that under this criteria you may not 
receive the full grade for simply having the correct final answer. You will need to include a reasonable number of 
steps highlighting your thought process and provide a clean, legible solution in order to get full credit.   
All assignments and grades will be posted on the course ELMS. Please check ELMS regularly and let me know if you 
have any questions or concerns. Assignments may contain a significant amount of computation. You will submit 
your solutions via Gradescope. You will need to create a single pdf of your work and upload it to Gradescope for 
grading (if you are unfamiliar with how to use Gradescope, please access the Student Hub for Gradescope via 
https://guides.gradescope.com/hc/en-us and read the starred articles. In addition please make sure that you read 
the article about submitting variable length assignments). You will be able to access the graded assignments via 
Gradescope as well. 
Your graded assignments will consist of five categories: Homework, Quizzes, R-Projects, Midterms and Final Exam.  
  
Homework: Homework assignments and due dates will be posted on ELMS. You should submit your solutions  on 
ELMS as well. You will usually have a homework assignment per week. You will need to scan your work and upload a 
pdf of your solutions into ELMS for grading. You will receive 40% of the grade for a homework set if you have 
 

completed (i.e. made a good faith attempt to answer) all the assigned problems. The other 60% of the grade will be 
assigned based on how well you have performed on a particular subset of the question. The particular subset of the 
questions that are worth 60% will not be announced before you submit the homework set.  
 
Quizzes: There will be, roughly, a quiz per week. Weekly quizzes will mostly focus on the material that was covered 
the week before and will take roughly 10-15 minutes to complete.  They will take place towards the end of class.    
 
Midterms will take place during regular class time and will take up a class period. They will be close book , closed 
notes.However, youI will be allowed a formula sheet for the exams (both sides of a handwritten A4 / letter size 
piece of paper)   
 
R-Projects: There will be several mini projects that you will need to complete using R. Like homework assignments, 
the due dates for R-projects will be announced in ELMS.  
 
Final Exam: The final exam is scheduled for May 15th from 10.30 AM - 12.30 PM. It will take place in our classroom. 
You will be allowed a formula sheet for the final exam as well (both sides of two handwritten A4 / letter size pieces 
of paper).  
 
You are allowed to collaborate and / or use resources beyond the textbook and class notes etc in certain 
circumstances. Please see the “Academic Integrity” section of the syllabus for further details. 
 
Calculator Policy: 
 
You may use a standard scientific / graphing calculator during exams. Examples include the Texas Instruments 
TI-30Xa scientific calculator and the Texas Instruments Ti-84 calculator. You will also not be permitted to use your 
phone, iPad etc as a calculator during exams. Please ask me if you are unsure about the calculator you are planning 
on using. The use of any other electronic devices during assignments as an aid to obtaining solutions is prohibited 
and their use would be considered as academic dishonesty. 
 
Make-up Policy 
 
Accommodations (extensions, make-up assignments) will be made in case of missed graded assignments with 
excused absences in accordance with university policy. Accommodations will not be made unless a student can 
present substantial evidence that an absence was caused by serious illness, a death in the immediate family, 
religious observance, participation in University activities at the request of University authorities, or compelling 
circumstances beyond the student’s control. If the absence is caused by foreseeable circumstances, notice must be 
given in advance in order to be allowed to take a makeup assignment. Students who do not provide adequate 
documentation for their absence will receive a score of zero for the corresponding assignment. 
 
Missed assignments must be made up in a timely manner, usually within a week of returning to class. Exemptions 
to this policy will be made on  a case by case basis if required. 
 
Reviewing your Grades 
 
If you would like to review any of your grades (including exams), or have questions about how something was 
scored, please email me or come to my office hours. I am happy to discuss any of your grades with you. 
 

MIstakes do happen when grading. If the TAs / graders / myself  have made a mistake, I will be happy to correct it. 
Please bring it to my attention as soon as possible.  
Any formal grade disputes must be submitted in writing and within one week of receiving the grade. It should 
include where you believe there is an error in grading.   
 
Academic Integrity 
 
You are expected to adhere to the academic integrity standards (www.ugst.umd.edu/courserelatedpolicies.html) set 
by the university.  
 
It is important to note that, for this particular class, you are not allowed to post homework questions (or solutions) 
or copy solutions for homework from course assistance websites, such as CourseHero, StackExchange, Chegg. AI 
generated content (for example R code) is not permitted. Material taken or copied from these sites can be deemed 
unauthorized material and a violation of academic integrity. Relying on restricted sources will hamper your learning 
process, particularly the critical thinking steps necessary for college-level assignments.  
Working with your classmates is a great way to learn material. I highly encourage you to do so. You are allowed to 
talk to each other about any non-proctored assignments (such as homework), discuss methods for obtaining the 
solutions, etc. However please note that working together is different from simply copying down someone else’s 
answers and passing them off as your own. The former is a great way to learn and the latter is academic dishonesty.   
Please visit the Office of Undergraduate Studies’ full list of campus-wide policies and reach out if you have 
questions. 
Finally, on each exam or assignment you must write out and sign the following pledge: "I pledge on my honor that I 
have not given or received any unauthorized assistance on this exam/assignment." If you ever feel pressured to 
comply with someone else’s academic integrity violation, please reach out to me straight away.  
 
To help you avoid unintentional violations, the following table lists levels of collaboration that are acceptable for 
each graded exercise.

Course Outline 
I have uploaded a tentative course schedule into ELMS (see “Files”). It contains the topics that we will be covering by 
week, dates on which exams are held etc. I may update it through the semester as required (to allow for campus 
closures due to bad weather etc). Please make sure that you check this document at least once a week.   
 
Resources & Accommodations 
If you are registered with the ADS office, please approach me to discuss your accommodations. 
 
Student Resources and Services (this applies mostly to lower-level courses) 
Taking personal responsibility for your own learning means acknowledging when your performance does not match 
your goals and doing something about it. I hope you will come talk to me so that I can help you find the right 
approach to success in this course, and I encourage you to visit UMD’s Student Academic Support Services website 
to learn more about the wide range of campus resources available to you. 
You should also know there are a wide range of resources to support you with whatever you might need (UMD’s 
Student Resources and Services website may help). If you feel it would be helpful to have someone to talk to, visit 
UMD’s Counseling Center or one of the many other mental health resources on campus. 
 
Other policies, suggestions, and information: Please see “Files” in ELMS for a pdf of various policies 
and suggestions that apply to all classes.
